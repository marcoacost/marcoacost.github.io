The final goal of this class is that you learn basic economic science. I will attempt to do this by preparing myself to teach you the concepts in a friendly manner, as well as to learn the best pedagogical techniques to do so. You can expect fairness from me, this includes but is not limited to grading. Any actions that interfere with the learning environment are unacceptable.
