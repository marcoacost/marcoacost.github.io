The presentation talk about the impact of the Full-Time School Program (FTSP) in Mexico. The FTSP extended the school day from 4.5 to 8 hours in selected schools. In the study I used a difference-in-differences approach to estimate the impacts of the FTSP in math and verbal test scores. The evidence suggests the FTSP has an overall positive effect on the verbal and math test scores of 0.13 and 0.15 standard deviations after four years into the program.
